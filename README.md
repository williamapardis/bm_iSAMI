# iSAMI Bristlemouth Interface Firmware
This includes the firmware for the Bristlemouth development kit to interface a Sofar Smart Spotter Mooring with Sunburst Sensor's iSAMI-pH instrument. 

The iSAMI-pH offers a "gold standard" pH measurement. It's low-drift [<0.002 pH units over 6 months] and acurate pH [0.01 pH units] in the ocean enviroment is made possible through internally referenced spectrophotometric methodology. The sensor runs autonomously at a configured measurement frequency and transmits data over a RS232 interface.
Working from the Bristlemouth RS232 Serial instruement example.
